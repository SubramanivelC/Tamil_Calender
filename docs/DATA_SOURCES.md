# Data Sources & Accuracy Policy

This app does **not fabricate calendar data**. Every stored festival and
observance row carries a `source` column, and dates that cannot be verified are
presented as approximate (≈) in the UI rather than as fact.

## Verified anchors (hard requirements)

| Fact | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Puthandu (Tamil New Year) | 14 Apr 2026 (Chithirai 1) | Widely published Tamil panchangams for 2026 |
| Tamil year starting 14 Apr 2026 | **Parabhava** (பராபவ) — cycle index 40 of 60 | Standard 60-year Samvatsara cycle lists |
| Thai 1 (Thai Pongal) | 14 Jan 2026 | Verified via published 2026 panchangams |
| Sunrise panchangam fields (tithi/nakshatra/yoga/karana) at 06:00 IST on 14 Oct, 19 Oct, 8 Nov 2026 | match Drik Panchang Chennai exactly (see tests) | drikpanchang.com day-panchang, Chennai geoname 1264527 |

## Engine design: why not Intl?

Node/ICU's `Intl.DateTimeFormat` does not support the `ca=tamil` calendar and
**silently falls back to Gregorian**, which would fabricate Tamil dates with no
error. The conversion engine
(`src/services/tamilCalendarService.ts`) therefore computes month boundaries
**astronomically**: the solar ingress (sankranti) instant at which the
sidereal sun enters each rasi is found with the app's ephemeris
(`panchangamAstro.ts`, truncated Meeus sun + linear Lahiri ayanamsa) and the
ingress is mapped to a calendar day in Chennai time (IST = UTC+5:30) using
the printed-calendar convention: sankranti before 13:00 IST starts the month
that day, at/after 13:00 IST the next day. The 13:00 cutoff is calibrated
against published Thirukanitha calendars (Prokerala/ClickAstro Chennai,
Drik Panchang); both boundary sides are locked by regression tests, together
with the full 2026 month-start set, Puthandu 2024-2026 and Thai 1 2024-2027
anchors (`src/utils/__tests__/tamilCalendarService.test.ts`). Results are
cached per navigated year, so day conversions stay cheap.

**Printed daily-sheet (Vakya tradition) divergence**: Vakya panchangam
sankranti times used by printed daily sheets can differ from true-time
computation by hours (documented by Drik Panchang). In verified cases the
printed month start is pinned by `PRINTED_MONTH_STARTS` overrides in the
engine, transcribed from published calendars: 2024 Masi 1 = Feb 13,
2026 Aavani 1 = Aug 18, 2026 Purattasi 1 = Sep 18 (so Oct 17 2026 =
Purattasi 30, matching printed sheets), 2027 Aavani 1 = Aug 17. All other
published month starts (full 2025 set incl. Aavani Aug 17 / Aippasi Oct 18,
Thai 1 = Jan 14) are already reproduced by the computed rule and locked by
the regression tests.

Verified published anchors reproduced by the engine (Chennai):

| Anchor | Verified value |
|---|---|
| Puthandu / Chithirai 1 | Apr 14 2024, 2025, 2026 |
| Thai Pongal / Thai 1 | Jan 14 2025, Jan 15 2026, Jan 15 2027 |
| Aippasi 1 | Oct 17 2024 (rule-computed, not printed-verified), Oct 18 2025, Oct 18 2026 |
| Aani 1 | Jun 15 2026 (Mithuna sankranti 12:49 IST same day) |
| Aadi 1 | Jul 17 2026 (Kataka sankranti 23:27 IST → next day) |

The 1900–2100 runtime range is covered by the ephemeris itself; outside the
printed-verified set the engine follows the Drik Thiru Ganita convention
exactly. Sankrantis landing within minutes of the 13:00 cutoff are the
engine's residual risk window — the published boundary cases bracket it, and
the printed-sheet override layer covers the verified Vakya divergences.

## Paksha, Amavasai, Pournami

- Paksha (Shukla/Krishna) is a structural approximation (day 1–15 vs 16–30) and
  is labelled as computed.
- **Amavasai and Pournami dates**: the printed Tamil calendars label the day
  on which the phase tithi BEGINS (amavasai tithi spans elongation
  [348°,360°), pournami tithi spans [168°,180°)) — not the conjunction
  instant's day. Within the dataset window, the 2026 rows are
  **transcription-verified from the published lists**
  (tamildailycalendar.com amavasai/pournami 2026, corroborated by Drik
  Panchang Chennai) and are the truth anchor (`data/__tests__/lunarPhases.test.ts`);
  2027–2029 and all other navigable years are engine-derived
  (`src/data/lunarPhases.ts` tithi-start junction rule), with an occasional
  ±1-day possibility on junction instants within the truncated series'
  hour-scale precision. A phase spans two calendar days in printing sources —
  the app always marks exactly ONE day (the printed convention), never two.
  So are the Pradosham (trayodashi)
  and Ekadasi (tithi 11) lists. The Meeus example anchors these computations
  in `src/services/__tests__/panchangamAstro.test.ts`.
- The same generators live in `src/data/lunarPhases.ts` (range-parameterized);
  the observance repositories run them **at runtime for every navigable year
  (1900–2100)**, so the dates do not stop at the bundled dataset window
  (2026–2029). The runtime output is regression-tested to equal the bundled
  seed rows for 2026–2029 (`src/data/__tests__/lunarPhases.test.ts`).

## Row verification flags

- `festival_occurrences.verified = 1` for rows with a public source (govt
  holiday list, published panchangams).
- `panchangam_records.verified = 0` for computed rows (Rahu Kalam etc. from
  classical weekday mapping; sunrise/sunset approximated by month).
- Absence of data is surfaced as *no data*, never as a fabricated placeholder:
  far-past/future dates outside the dataset return `null` Tamil day, and
  repository helpers return empty arrays rather than inventing rows.

## Restoring / updating the dataset

The bundled dataset is versioned via `DATASET_VERSION` in seedData. Bump it and
the next app start re-imports festivals/observances inside one transaction
(`dataset_meta.version` gate). To validate a data change:

```bash
npm test            # includes dataset-integrity tests: sources present,
                    # amavasai/pournami/pradosham/ekadasi counts > threshold,
                    # search-index populated from festivals
```

Dataset-integrity expectations live in `src/database/__tests__/migrate.test.ts`.
